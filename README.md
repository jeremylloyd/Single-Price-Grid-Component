## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Svelte

### What I learned

- Svelte
  - By default, SvelteKit is configured to prefer static content be served from the `/static` directory. Use it instead of the `/images` directory I've used for previous projeccts
- NodeJS
  - Deploying on Github Pages took some extra steps
  - Svelte is using a number of other packages behind the scenes, resulting in searches for 'deploy Svelte project' not coming up with many results. Instead, 'deploy vite project' and 'deploy nodejs project' were more useful
  - [This link](https://blog.codedbyjordan.com/deploying-a-vite-app-with-github-actions) was a great reference
